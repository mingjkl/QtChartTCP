# QtChartTCP

我想做一个测量USB电流的项目，其中下位机通过TCP将数据发送到上位机。上位机使用QT编写的UI界面将N个通道的测量数据以曲线的形式实时显示。

I want to make a project to measure the USB current where the lower computer sends the data to the upper computer through TCP. The upper computer's UI interface, written in QT, displays the measurement data of N channels in real-time in the form of a curve.

同时这也是我尝试使用OpenAI协助一起做的项目。

 At the same time, this is also a project that I am trying to do with the assistance of OpenAI.
